					<h1 class="h1">Privacy Policy</h1>
						<h2 class="h2">Website Visitors</h2>
			<p class="text">Like most website operators, GitHub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GitHub's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GitHub's visitors use its website. From time to time, GitHub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p class="text">GitHub also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://github.com blog posts. GitHub only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
			
						<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
			<p class="text">Certain visitors to GitHub's websites choose to interact with GitHub in ways that require GitHub to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that GitHub gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://github.com to provide a username and email address.</p>
			
						<h2>Security</h2>
			<p class="text">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
			
						<h2>Advertisements</h2>
			<p class="text">Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GitHub and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
			

						<h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
			<p class="text">Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
			<p class="text">We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>
			
			
			
						<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
			<p class="text">GitHub may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. GitHub may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, GitHub does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>
			
			
			
						<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
			<p class="text">Although most changes are likely to be minor, GitHub may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GitHub's sole discretion. GitHub encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
